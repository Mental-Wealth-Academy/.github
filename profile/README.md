# Mental Wealth Academy

**Investing in the capital of the human mind, with the heart of tomorrow.**

We build research-driven tools at the intersection of cyber-psychology, AI governance, and decentralized education. Our platform helps learners understand their own cognition — then puts them in the driver's seat of the systems that shape it.
